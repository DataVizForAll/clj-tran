      <h1>Where is Your Money Going? How funding is distributed in Connecticut Schools for Students with Learning Needs</h1>
      <h4>Investigating the Relationship between Per Pupil Expenditure (PPE) for Students with Disabilities (SWD) in Schools in Connecticut</h4>

          <h2>The Question</h2>
          <p class="lead">Introduction</p>

          <p>Although in Connecticut, over $12 billion is spent on K-12 public education, this spending is not distributed equitably across school districts and towns (<a href="https://schoolstatefinance.org/issues/how-ct-funds-education">School State Finance</a>). The Education Cost Sharing (ECS) formula is used to take into consideration student learning needs when calculating costs of funding in order to more equitably fund students with learning needs.</p>

          <p> Despite this, schools across the state are still not funded equitably (<a href="https://schoolstatefinance.org/issues/how-ct-funds-education">School State Finance</a>). This results in marginalized students (BIPOC students, students with disabilities, low-income students, etc) being disproportionately affected.</p>
          
          <p> According to Lauren Ruth, a research and policy director of Connecticut Voices, “We’ve seen a decline in the performance of special education students, which suggests our funding doesn’t provide an appropriate education” (Bamberger 2021). In particular, students with disabilities lack not only the funding, but the resources across Connecticut that would adequately fund their education.</p>

          <p>In order to begin addressing these funding inequities, it is important to ask the following questions: How do enrollment rates by school type vary by students with (and without) disabilities and how does district-level per-student spending vary by percent of students with disabilities?</p>

          <h2>Key Findings</h2>
          <p> In the following two charts, Figure 1 and 2, (linked <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZUaFYQmiRsL4VwEOk2X82IWwuinxJnjeoPb3LZcLZFY/edit#gid=320257753'>here</a>) the data gathered from <a href='https://public-edsight.ct.gov/Overview/Resident-Town-Dashboard/Resident-Town-Export?language=en_US'>EdSight</a> shows that there is a very high percentage of students with disabilities enrolled in program school types.</p>

          <p>The towns, New Britain and East Hartford, were chosen as examples because these towns have high percentages of students with disabilities enrolled in their schools. Because of these high enrollment numbers, these were important towns to look at when taking into account funding disparities for students with learning needs.</p>
          <p>In both charts, there is no data for other magnet or open choice schools because there are five or less students with disabilities enrolled in these schools. When there are less than five students with disabilities enrolled in a school, the data is suppressed and will not show up in order to protect the student(s)’s information.</p>
          <p>As seen in the charts, the other school types have a considerable percentage of students with disabilities, but many of these students are concentrated in program schools.</p>

          <p>Figure 2 | <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/4FHiF/">Link to Chart</a>

          <p>This is <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/4FHiF/">a link</a> to the interactive chart. Here, this chart shows a comparison between Per Pupil Expenditure versus percentage of students with disabilities enrolled by district. However, the amount of funding doesn't increase along with the percentage of SWD. </p>
          <p>Using data from EdSight, the raw data was pulled from two different tables. One raw data set shows the PPE by district and the other shows the number of students with disabilities enrolled by district. The enrollment of students with disabilities by district was converted into a percentage. This data was processed this way in order to show a comparison between the PPE and percentage of students with disabilities enrolled by district.</p>
          <p>By looking at Chart 3 and taking into account the ECS formula mentioned earlier, there is no significant trend or positive correlation between the percentage of students with disabilities enrolled by district and the PPE by district. Although there are three outlying districts that can be seen near the bottom of the chart, it still does not change the fact that there is no significant trend between PPE and the percentage of enrolled students with disabilities.</p>
          <p>Based on all three charts and previous background information, this means that students with disabilities are not at schools that allocate appropriate funding to their educational needs. This is important to note because in order to work towards a more equitable future where all students receive the funding that they need, current funding disparities need to be taken into account and talked about with school boards and other community organizations and members.</p>

          <h2>Data Methods</h2>
          <p>These charts were created using data from EdSight. In order to create this data story, the raw data had to be filtered and processed by the 33 towns and 38 districts that were relevant to the class’s community partner, Center for Leadership and Justice. When figuring out the percentage of students with disabilities enrolled in New Britain and East Hartford, the raw number of students with disabilities was divided by the total number of students and sorted by school type.</p>
          
          <p>The same thing was done to get the percentage enrolled of students of disabilities by district in Chart 3. However, in that chart, the PPE data was extracted from the raw data and sorted by the relevant districts using VLOOKUP. After using VLOOKUP to narrow down the data to the relevant districts, the processed data was organized using Datawrapper to create a scatter chart to show the comparisons between the PPE and enrollment of students with disabilities.</p>

          <h2>Concluding Thoughts and Limitations</h2>

          <p>Some things to consider is that if the number of students enrolled is five or less, then the data will be suppressed and not show up for calculations– which is why there is no data for school types such as other magnet and open choice in Charts 1 and 2. When processing the raw data, there were a few school districts that did not have any data available at all, which is why they all may not be seen in Chart 3.</p>
        
          <p>It is also important to note that this is data taken from the school year ending (SYE) in 2021, and data from before the pandemic in 2020 may show different trends that might not correlate with the most recent data.</p>
        
          <p>Lastly, another thing to be aware of is the outline data, Capitol Region Education Council (CREC). CREC includes around 18 schools, but there was no data to be found for SWD. It is hard to imagine that CREC would have less than five SWD across 18 schools. However, they also could be suppressing this data to protect their students, which is why there was no data shown for CREC.</p>
