      <h1>Where is Your Money Going? How funding is distributed in Connecticut Schools for Students with Learning Needs</h1>
      <h4>Investigating the Relationship between Per Pupil Expenditure (PPE) for Students with Disabilities (SWD) in Schools in Connecticut</h4>

          <h2>The Question</h2>
          <p class="lead">Introduction</p>

          <p>Although in Connecticut, over $12 billion is spent on K-12 public education, this spending is not distributed equitably across school districts and towns (<a href="https://schoolstatefinance.org/issues/how-ct-funds-education">School State Finance</a>). The Education Cost Sharing (ECS) formula is used to take into consideration student learning needs when calculating costs of funding in order to more equitably fund students with learning needs.</p>

          <p> Despite this, schools across the state are still not funded equitably (<a href="https://schoolstatefinance.org/issues/how-ct-funds-education">School State Finance</a>). This results in marginalized students (BIPOC students, students with disabilities, low-income students, etc) being disproportionately affected. In particular, students with disabilities lack not only the funding, but the resources across Connecticut that would adequately fund their education.</p>

          <p>In order to begin addressing these funding inequities, it is important to ask the following questions: How do enrollment rates by school type vary by students with (and without) disabilities and how does district-level per-student spending vary by percent of students with disabilities?</p>


          <iframe title="Per Pupil Expenditure (PPE) vs. Percentage of Students with Disabilities (SWD) Enrolled by District (2020-21)" aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-4FHiF" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4FHiF/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

          <p>This is <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/4FHiF/">a link</a> to the interactive chart. Here, this chart shows a comparison between Per Pupil Expenditure versus percentage of students with disabilities enrolled by district. However, the amount of funding doesn't increase along with the percentage of SWD. </p>

          <h2>Key Findings</h2>
          <p> In the following two charts, Chart 1 and 2, (linked <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZUaFYQmiRsL4VwEOk2X82IWwuinxJnjeoPb3LZcLZFY/edit#gid=320257753'>here</a>) the data gathered from EdSight shows that there is a very high percentage of students with disabilities enrolled in program school types.</p>
          
          <img src="C:\Users\tngoc\OneDrive\Desktop\new britain chart.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
          
          <p>The towns, New Britain and East Hartford, were chosen as examples because these towns have high percentages of students with disabilities enrolled in their schools. Because of these high enrollment numbers, these were important towns to look at when taking into account funding disparities for students with learning needs. </p>
          <p> In both charts, there is no data for other magnet or open choice schools because there are five or less students with disabilities enrolled in these schools. When there are less than five students with disabilities enrolled in a school, the data is suppressed and will not show up in order to protect the student(s)’s information. As seen in the charts, the other school types have a considerable percentage of students with disabilities, but many of these students are concentrated in program schools.</p>

          <h2>Data Methods</h2>
          <p>Give credit to people, organizations, resources, and tools that helped you to create this data story. Write in HTML format and include links when appropriate. If you wish to cite a reading, use any acceptable bibiography style and include a web link when available, similar to this sample:</p>

          <h2>Concluding Thoughts and Limitations</h2>

          <p>Change names of `Section 1` etc. to customized navigation labels that make sense for your data story, such as `Why It Matters` or `How We Made This` etc. To do this you must change names in TWO places: see the Navigation Container (around lines 30-50) and the corresponding Sections below. Keep the section numbers but change the reader-friendly labels.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders: Use H4 tags to break up long sections</h4>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML img tag as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Quickly Edit and View Changes on Your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>HINT: Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub, you can quickly make edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps (in HTML format):
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <li>Install a free code editor tool. My fav is <a href="https://atom.io">Atom Editor</a> but there are others, too.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer.</li>
              <li>After making some edits in the "index.html" file, save it, and refresh your browser to view changes. Most edits should appear right away.</li>
              <li>After making multiple edits on your local computer, carefully copy and paste the contents of "index.html" in your online GitHub account, and test your published updates online.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
          .tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
          .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
            overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
          .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;

          </style>
          <table class="tg">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header A</th>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header B</th>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header C</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">123</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">456</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">789</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">987</td>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">654</td>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">321</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
